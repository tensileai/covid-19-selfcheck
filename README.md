Open-source self-assessment tool focused on individuals without access to internet or smartphones

Tensile AI has open-sourced code, based on CDC guidelines, to enable organizations to develop COVID-19 self-assessment applications focusing on individuals without access to internet or smartphones. Many tools have been developed since the outbreak of the pandemic to help individuals assess their symptoms and determine if they are a candidate for a COVID-19 test. These require smartphone or internet access. Recognizing the vulnerability and risk in populations that lack connectivity, we are offering our code as a quick-start to organizations looking to implement assessment tools for this segment of the population. We envision applications that allow an individual to interact with a Bot to help determine whether he/she is vulnerable to COVID-19, and if so, obtain information on his/her best course of action for getting tested. While we created this code for the current COVID-19 crisis, we hope that if a future health crisis arises, it can serve as an implementation primer when time, especially for these populations, is of the essence.
